        <h2>Rociah's Ambition: Veterinary Doctor</h2>
        <p>Rociah, on the other hand, had always envisioned herself as a lawyer. She admired the way legal professionals fought for justice and defended the rights of others. However, as she grew older, she discovered a deeper calling—a love for animals that she couldn’t ignore. Her compassion for injured and sick animals made her reconsider her path, and soon, she realized that veterinary medicine was her true passion. She decided to pursue a career as a veterinary doctor, dedicating her life to healing and caring for animals.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the shift in her career aspirations, Rociah remains confident in her decision. She believes that helping animals live healthier lives is just as impactful as fighting for human rights. With determination, she studies tirelessly, learning about animal health, surgery, and treatment methods. While her journey started with a different dream, she now walks a path that fulfills her heart’s true desire, proving that sometimes, our greatest ambitions find us when we least expect them.</p>
